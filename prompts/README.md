# Prompts

## Purpose
The purpose of this folder is to catalog the iterations of requirements/prompts used to build this tool. This tool heavily developed in conjunction with AI. I took the role of a project manager and not an engineer. I only leveraged my engineering skills to help debug once the AI got stuck trying to debug.

## Rounds
- [round1.md](round1.md) - gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25 - Requirements generated as a result of requirements and the ideal tech stack with AI.
- [round2.md](round2.md) - gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25 - Prompt to recreate given after debugging for CSV with Hugo issue.
